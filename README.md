Syllabi for courses I have taught at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. The outlines are formatted in XeLaTeX. Feel free to draw upon them in your own course design, but if you do so, I'd like to hear about it. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please email me at craig@theoria.ca.
